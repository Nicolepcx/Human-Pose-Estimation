# Human-Pose-Estimation
Human Pose Estimation with Deep Neural Nets

With the recent popularity of Augmented Reality (AR), human pose estimation has become an important tool to enhance AR experiences. Novel applications in gaming, entertainment, shopping, sports and fitness coaching depend on human poses.

In this project, we will build a human pose estimation algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we use an object detector to detect a person in an image, and then build and train a CNN from scratch to detect keypoints of the human body. At the end you should have an interactive demo that uses a laptops webcam to do human pose estimation.
